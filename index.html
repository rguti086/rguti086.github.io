        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics/ Administrative Studiesüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Rubi Gutierrez, and I am a second-year Economics and Administrative Studies major at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently exploring concentrations in both statistics and accounting to further deepen my understanding of quantitative and financial analysis. I am particularly fascinated by the analytical and financial aspects of economics, especially as they apply to data-driven decision-making processes. My studies have cultivated a strong passion for examining how economic trends impact choices at both individual and organizational levels, and I am excited to explore how these principles can be applied in real-world scenarios to drive sustainable growth and efficiency.
<br><br>

        Through my academic journey and practical experiences, I have developed a solid foundation in financial tasks and administrative responsibilities. For example, I have hands-on experience with essential financial processes, such as creating invoices, processing payments, and managing accounts payable, which has taught me the importance of accuracy and efficiency in financial transactions. Additionally, I regularly utilize mobile banking for check deposits and am familiar with a variety of administrative tasks that support office operations. These tasks include filing, document management, and responding to client inquiries, often regarding quotes for services. Each of these experiences has helped me develop a strong sense of organization, attention to detail, and effective communication skills. I find great satisfaction in maintaining organized systems and responding promptly to client needs, as these qualities are critical in both administrative and financial roles. Beyond academics, I am actively involved in volunteer work, where I have gained valuable customer service and event management experience. I volunteered at a basketball concession stand, which taught me how to handle sales transactions under pressure, manage inventory, and engage with customers. My responsibilities included setting up snack displays, collecting payments, and taking inventory after each event, which gave me insight into the dynamics of customer service and sales. Additionally, I volunteered at a local robotics convention, where I had the opportunity to greet and direct guests, help set up and clean up event spaces, and ensure a smooth flow of activities throughout the competition. These volunteer experiences have not only helped me build communication and teamwork skills but also allowed me to engage with people in dynamic environments, which I find both challenging and rewarding.
<br><br>

        In my free time, I prioritize staying physically active, as I believe physical health is essential for overall well-being. I am an avid gym-goer and enjoy hiking in scenic locations, which allows me to connect with nature while staying fit. I also enjoy trying new sports as a way to continually challenge myself. Additionally, I have a passion for cooking, especially high-protein meals that complement my active lifestyle. Experimenting in the kitchen with nutritious and flavorful recipes has become a creative outlet for me. I find it deeply rewarding to create meals that are both enjoyable and supportive of my health goals, and I am always on the lookout for new ways to incorporate protein-rich ingredients into my diet. As I move forward in my studies and career, I am eager to connect with professionals in the fields of economics, finance, and data analysis. I am enthusiastic about learning more about industry applications of economic principles and exploring opportunities for hands-on experience that can further enhance my skills and understanding.‚Äù**
